# analyzing-and-creating-music
As a lifelong musician, I became interested in music production in college when opening up an app on my laptop became more convenient than walking to the music department to practice the piano. I have produced a variety of genres and am constantly interested in learning more about the composition of music, creating new sounds, and understanding music theory at a deeper level.

I have added a song ('shake it') to this repo whose production was inspired by much of the sound analysis I have learned via python over the past few years. The rest of the files are snippets of some of my exploration into this topic.

Check out the song here: https://vimeo.com/498005439
